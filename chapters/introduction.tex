\section{Thesis Outline}

\section{Motivation}

The publish/subscribe communication paradigm is receiving an increasing
amount of attention from the research community, as it provides a
loosely coupled and scalable interaction scheme suitable for large-scale
distributed systems~\cite{Eugster:2003}. It has also shown to be a useful
approach for several business applications such as financial data
dissemination~\cite{tibcorv} and application integration~\cite{goops}.
Topic-based pub/sub has also seen more novel applications such as
decentralised social networks. More specifically, the issue of
delivering notifications in such a network is a task especially suited
for this approach. This motivates further investigation into such
systems, comparing their performance and analysing their
characteristics and shortcomings.
