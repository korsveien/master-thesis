\section{Intended Audience}

The main target audience for this master thesis are researchers within
the field of distributed systems, specifically those whose field of
study is peer-to-peer (P2P) decentralised networks and the
Publish-Subscribe paradigm. But any computer science student with a
healthy interest in the field should be able to both understand and
benefit from reading this thesis.


\section{Motivation for Thesis}

The Publish-Subscribe (pub/sub) communication paradigm is receiving an
increasing amount of attention from the research community, as it
provides a loosely coupled and scalable interaction scheme suitable for
large-scale distributed systems~\cite{Eugster:2003}. It has also shown
to be a useful approach for several business applications such as
financial data dissemination~\cite{tibcorv} and application
integration~\cite{goops}.  Topic-based pub/sub has also seen more novel
applications such as decentralised social networks. More specifically,
the issue of delivering notifications in such a network is a task
especially suited for this approach. This motivates further
investigation into such systems, comparing their performance and
analysing their characteristics and shortcomings.

In~\cite{Setty:2012}, we provided a mini-survey of several existing
state-of-the-art topic-based pub/sub systems, illustrating their
different characteristics and highlighting their shortcomings. However,
there is a need for an ever deeper evaluation and comparisons of these
systems, and we feel such a comparison would be a great contribution to
the research community.
