\chapter*{Abstract}

The Publish/Subscribe (pub/sub) paradigm is receiving an increasing
amount of attention both in research and in industry, as it provides a
loosely coupled and scalable interaction scheme suitable for large-scale
distributed systems. Designers of such system face many difficulties
related to finding the correct balance of performance, as many desired
properties of pub/sub systems are at stake with each other. Also, many
considerations must be taken with regards to the overlays formed by
these systems both in terms of maintenance of the overlay as well as
structural properties such as clustering and connectivity. With these
issues in mind, we propose \demo{}, a tool for visualizing the
performance of overlay-based pub/sub systems. \demo{} is able to log
local information from every node participating in the overlay, and
collect this information to a single site. Then, our tool is able to
calculate certain system-wide metrics and produce step-by-step
visualizations of the overlay in question. To the best of our knowledge,
\demo{} is the first tool of its kind. It is a generic tool intended to
be used with any overlay-based system. We describe the system
architecture and explore the capabilities of \demo{} by providing
examples of visualizations and what information we may derive from them.
Also, we test the potential of using our tool as a convenient framework
for evaluating pub/sub system on a set of specific overlay topology
metrics. We presented a poster and held a live demonstration of \demo{} at the
ACM International Conference of Distributed Event Based Systems (DEBS),
hosted in Mumbai in May 2014. Here, the value of our contribution was
confirmed as we were voted best poster/demonstration by the participants
attending the conference. Due to interest in our tool, we choose to make
our implementation code open source and available in a public
repository.\footnote{\url{htttp://github.com/vizpub/vizpub}} Hopefully,
\demo{} may serve as a lasting contribution to the research community.

\chapter*{Aknowledgements}

First of all, my thanks goes to Roman Vitenberg and Vinay Setty the
discussions, directions and feedback while working on this thesis. The
assistance they provided before and during the DEBS conference was
particularly helpful, as it was a hugely important factor in giving my
thesis a much clearer goal and direction. Also, my thanks goes to Spyros
Voulgaris who provided access to PeerNet, as well as technical support.
A huge thanks goes to my family and friends for their support during the
tough times, especially my parents, who supported me emotionally as well
as financially by letting me move back in to my old room to hack away
and write during the last few months of my thesis work. Many thanks to
Robin, who let me use his couch when I needed to stay in Oslo a few days
during the summer as well as showering me with his anti-academic rants
which I found to be surprisingly motivating. My thanks also go to Anette
and Christine, for their understanding and support. And lastly, I would
like to give my thanks to to J\o rgen for his unique perspective on life
which always keeps my mood up.
